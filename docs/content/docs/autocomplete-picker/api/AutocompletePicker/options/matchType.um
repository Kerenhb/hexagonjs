@property matchType [String]
  @description
    The type of filtering the autocomplete picker should use when filtering internally

    The internal filter uses the @code[hx.filter] functions. All the filter types can be specified as the match type (e.g. 'startsWith', 'exact' or 'fuzzy') and the default value is 'contains'

    In addition to the internal filter, external matching can be used (where the data returned from the callback is used directly and not sorted/filtered internally) by setting the match type to 'external'
  @default: 'contains'

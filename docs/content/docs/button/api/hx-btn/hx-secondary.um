      Added the buttons to match the updated UX guidelines

  @description
    A button for use inside forms to allow actions to be performed on form fields.

    The secondary button should be paired with a form field. And the functionality of the secondary button should be related to the form field itâ€™s paired with.

    Like the Primary button, the Secondary button is optional - only use it if a form requires it.

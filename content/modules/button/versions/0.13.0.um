@version 0.13.0
  @api Button
    @info: Removed default call to hx.initializeToggleButtons. Toggle buttons must now be explicitly created with the @code[hx.ToggleButton] class.
    @function hx.initializeToggleButtons
      @deprecated: This function no longer makes sense as the state of a toggle button matters and is managed by the ToggleButton class.
      @param selector [String]

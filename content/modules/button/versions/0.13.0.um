      @description
        Removed default call to hx.initializeToggleButtons. Toggle buttons must
        now be explicitly created with the @code[hx.ToggleButton] class.
    @function hx.initializeToggleButtons
      @param selector [String]
      @deprecated
        @description
          This function no longer makes sense as the state of a toggle button
          matters and is managed by the ToggleButton class.

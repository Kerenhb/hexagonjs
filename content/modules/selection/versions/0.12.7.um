        @issue 542
        @p: Selection now handles namespaced attributes (which are most prevalent in svg). eg
        @codeblock js
          text.attr('xlink:href', '#curvePath')

      @enhancement
        @issue 543
        @p: Selection now handles removal of styles with undefined (so that it works in the same was as selection.attr). eg
        @codeblock js
          text.style('color', undefined)

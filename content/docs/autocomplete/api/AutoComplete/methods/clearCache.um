@method clearCache
  @description
    A method to clear the cached data in the auto complete.

    It is called internally when the user changes focus (either by clicking
    outside the input box or by tabbing out of the box) but can be called
    manually if the data needs to be cleared more frequently (i.e. as the
    user types)

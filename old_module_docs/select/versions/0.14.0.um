@version 0.14.0
  @api Select
    @prototype hx.Select
      @deprecated: This has been renamed to hx.Picker to avoid confusion with the selection api. Rename all uses of hx.Select to hx.Picker (the api is the same).

      @constructor
        @arg selector [String/HTMLElement]
        @arg? ddClass [String]
        @removed: Use @code[hx.Picker(selector, options)] instead.

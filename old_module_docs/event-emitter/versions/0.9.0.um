  @api Event Emitter

    @prototype hx.EventEmitter
      @description
        A class that can be extended or used standalone to provide a way of emitting events to named registered callbacks. This is generally used internally to give objects the .on method for listening for events, but can be used as a standalone object if desired.

      @constructor
        @description: Creates a new EventEmitter instance.

      @method emit
        @description: Emits an event to all listeners registered under the name supplied.
        @arg name [String]: The event type to emit.
        @arg data [Object]: Any data that should be sent along with the event
        @returns EventEmitter: This event emitter

      @method on
        @description
          Register a callback that will be called whenever an event is emitted under the given name
        @arg name [String]: The event type to listen out for
        @arg callback [Function]
          @description: The function to call when the event occurs
          @arg data [EventData]: The data sent along with the event
        @returns EventEmitter: This event emitter

      @method off
        @description
          De-register a callback that was registered under the given name
        @arg? name [String]: The event type this callback was registered under.
        @arg? callback [Function]: The callback function to remove.
        @returns EventEmitter: This event emitter

      @method deregister
        @description
          De-register a callback that was registered under the given name
        @arg name [String]: The event type this callback was registered under.
        @arg callback [Function]: The callback function to remove.
        @returns EventEmitter: This event emitter

      @method deregisterAll
        @description
          De-registers all callbacks registered under a particular name, or, if no name is supplied de-register all callbacks.
        @arg? name [String]: The event type to de-register callbacks for. If not specified, all callbacks for all names will be removed.
        @returns EventEmitter: This event emitter

      @method pipe
        @description
          Pipes events from this event emitter into another. This makes it possible to chain multiple event emitters together if wanted.
        @arg eventEmitter [EventEmitter]: The event emitter to send events to.
        @arg? prefix [String]
          @description
            A string to append to the names of events that get piped through
